# Self-Jailbreaking of Reasoning Language Models

This is the official repository for the paper "Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training".

## üöÄ Quick Setup

```sh
# set your OPENAI API KEY
export OPENAI_API_KEY=... 

# set up your virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate

# install packages
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Identifying Self-Jailbreaking within CoT

| Scripts    | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| scripts/inference/vllm_gen{_s1}.py    | Inference on StrongReject prompts |
| scripts/eval/strongreject_eval.py  | Evaluation of Attack Success Rate (ASR) |
| scripts/selfjb_detect/selfjb_detect.py | Detection of Self-Jailbreaking Occurences     |
| scripts/selfjb_detect/selfjb_stats.py | Stats of Self-Jailbreaking Occurences     |

Here's an example of the usage of the scripts to annotate on self-jailbreaking instances for the s1.1-7B model.

```bash
python3 ./scripts/inference/vllm_gen_s1.py --model_name "simplescaling/s1.1-7B"
python3 ./scripts/eval/strongreject_eval.py --input_file ./outputs/s1.1-7B-think500-answer200.jsonl
python3 ./scripts/selfjb_detect/selfjb_detect.py --input_file ./outputs/oai_aisi_eval/oai_aisi-gpt5-labeled_s1.1-7B-think500-answer200.jsonl
python3 ./scripts/selfjb_detect/selfjb_stats.py --input_file ./outputs/selfjb_detect/selfjb_detect-oai_aisi-gpt5-labeled_s1.1-7B-think500-answer200-start0-end313.jsonl


# NOTE: use `vllm_gen.py` for non-s1 models
# python3 ./scripts/inference/vllm_gen.py --model_name "microsoft/Phi-4-mini-reasoning" (for non-s1 models)
```

### üíæ Artifacts

`./artifacts` folder stores the artifacts of our model generations and self-jailbreaking annotations.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Safety Reasoning Training: Safe-s1.1-7B

You can set `--sample_size` hyperparameter to decide the percentage of training samples to use from the [STAR-1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA/STAR-1) safety reasoning dataset.

```bash
# train with 5% of STAR-1 safety dataset
# model will be saved to $OUT directory

python3 ./scripts/safety_training/train_safe_s1.py
    --sample_size 0.05 \ 
    --output_dir $OUT
```

ü§ó We also uploaded our model weights to our [HuggingFace collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/BatsResearch/safe-s11-68d6577961edca25c9619470).
